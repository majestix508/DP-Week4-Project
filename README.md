# Data Products Week 4 Project

## Shiny Application
This Shiny application for the course is located in the folder shinyApp. The files `ui.R` and `server.R`
contain a simple Shiny application demonstrating how reactive input is handled to dynamically update the 
user-interface and plot `mtcars` data using the `ggplot2` package.

The application is deployed here: https://majestix508.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/

## RPresentation
The `presentation.Rpres` file is a slide-deck in RPresentation. It demonstrates some of the 
most important features to slide presentations such as in-line code execution and
rendering of plots (again using the `mtcars` dataset and the `ggplot2` package).
